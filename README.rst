.. _introduction:

A stream that generates a merkle tree based on the incoming data
----------------------------------------------------------------

From `The Dat Protocol`_: 

.. _The Dat Protocol: https://datprotocol.github.io/book/ch01-01-flat-tree.html

    A merkle tree is a hash tree or Merkle tree is a tree in which every leaf
    node is labelled with the hash of a data block and every non-leaf node is
    labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes.
    Merkle Trees in Dat are specialized `Flat Trees`_ that contain the content
    of the archives.
